- 👋 Hi, I’m Ihsan Ullah and I teach Finance.
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis and big data management.
- 🌱 I've recently started learning programming. I started this journey with C and Python in September, 2021. Then I proceeded to Object Oriented Programming in C++ and
      Python. Currently, I am learning Pandas. I plan to learn next Matplotlib, MySQL, and Django. Fortunately, I already know Statistics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any data management and analysis project.
- 📫 How to reach me ihsan.ullah@nu.edu.pk
